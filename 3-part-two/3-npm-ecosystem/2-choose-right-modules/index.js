// Sort the possible target modules (e.g., for resizing image files) with its popularity counts in the last week.

// Then check the details in the documentation, and the maintainance frequencies (date of latest package released,
// how long have it been published, Github Issues frequencies and interactions, etc.)

// After minimizing the modules to 1-3, check how many features does the package support with your own needs.
// Remember to try to install the minimum number of dependencies.

// Also remember to check how frequent does the author respond to issues (ideally in a week).
// Then use this site: https://npm.anvaka.com to check how many dependencies does the package require (and with the licenses),
// also with who the maintainers are and whether they are trusted.

// In terms of the language, if a package is constructed more than JavaScript code, 
// it could mean that it is not limited by the node environment, as it is native code.

// Use "npm install -g nsecure" command, and followed by "nsecure from sharp",
// which will download the code and analyze the table, and thus running static analysis.
// A new window is opened in the browser, which demonstrate the security of the modules (including extensions, licenses and maintainers),
// with every packages' status (e.g., alive, dead, depreciated, etc.) and possible warnings.
