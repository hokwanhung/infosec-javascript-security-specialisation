How to deal with vulnerable dependencies:

0. Knowing abotu the report (`npm audit`).
1. Read the report (check also the information provided on https://www.npmjs.com). 
2. Identify the Module (`npm ls clean-css` to understand what dependencies it is related to).
3. Identify the impacts (check the commits and locate the possible unit tests).
-> if not impacted -> nice!
-> if impacted /!\ plan for fix and understand what input gets in this path (whether it is input from users or internal codes).
4. Plan for updates.
