// Serverless is about the abstract of services, e.g., create and maintain the authentication.
// Next, whether they can abstract the architecture of the application.

// It cannot replace all of the servers' functions, however, it is great for certain resouces,
// with a lot of scaling for certain features for certain functions.

// It is not very good to use Node.js with Google or AWS Lambda as the function provider,
// as Node.js is designed to handle multiple requests on the single thread.

// However, apart from Google, most situations would not share the same thread and use multiple processors.

// Google Firebase is very popular, especially for mobile applications.
// AWS Lambda is the flagship product for the serverless application - the first to bring that to large-scale.
