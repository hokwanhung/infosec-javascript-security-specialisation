For serverless Node.js applications:

1. Have the project in a Version Control System (never have something with an unsafe storage).

2. Deploy code through CLI:
2-alt. Use infrastucture as code and commit it on a VCS (never actually drag and drop things into an interface).

With the above two items, it would be much easier to rebuild the server quickly if something happens.

3. Have Secrets in env variables or, better, secret store (Cloud Provider ones, but could be expensive).

4. Test locally and in CI (use code coverage in testing as well).
